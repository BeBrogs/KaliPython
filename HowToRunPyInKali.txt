Why are we coding in python

Writing own tools differentiates you from those using pre-made tools

'Script kiddy' - Someone who only uses tools w/out knowing about the programming behind


The tools you use from other people will break sometime


Learning to code will let you use whatever hacking tool you want for whenever you want



Why use python?
1. Python is the hackers programming language as it is a scripting language & it allows us
 to create programs in a quick-pace


2. Any of these script/hack tools will take longer comparitavely with the likes of c, c++, c#
Python also easier than C

if you understand syntax you'll be able to understand the behind the scenes of our tools better


How to open python2 interpreter in kali:

simply in your pwd type python

Why use interpreter? - Helps w/ live Testing as it gives error right away


if a line of ours has executed properly we will be returned to the

However,
	import oss <-- oss isn't an existing library, will return error then back to: >>>

Now we specify our path to the python library:
	
#!/usr/bin/python


TO SAVE:
crtl o 	- Write out
enter file name



TO EXIT PYTHON IDLE KALI
ctrl x 	- Exit



TO MAKE FILE EXECUTABLE
METHOD 1:
	type in current directory:

	python3 myFileName.py 

METHOD 2:
	type in current directory:

	chmod +x myFileName.py		||	Pseudocode:	(change mod) (into executable) myFileName.py

	./myFileName.py			|| Runs file like any other file in terminal
